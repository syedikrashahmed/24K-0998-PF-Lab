//QUESTION#4
//A car travelled back and forth from point A to point B. With a distance being (single trip) 1207KM. During the forward trip fuel price was 118/liter while returning it was 123/liter. Calculate the total fuel cost (both ways) and the fuel consumed (total trip). Use the carâ€™s fuel average as input from the user (Input must be positive make some restrictions on only accepting positive input)

#include <stdio.h>

	int const distance = 1207;
	float fuelAvg, litres, costDist1, costDist2, totalCost, totalFuel;
	printf("Enter fuel average: ");
	scanf("%f", &fuelAvg);
	if (fuelAvg > 0)
		{litres = distance / fuelAvg;
		costDist1 = litres * 118;
		costDist2 = litres * 123;
		totalCost = costDist1 + costDist2;
		totalFuel = litres * 2;
		printf("The total cost is %f and the total fuel consumed is %f", totalCost, totalFuel);}
